    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>An recipe from &copy;Allrecipes. When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to Allrecipes more than 20
        years ago, he had no idea how successful it would become. One of Allrecipes top-performing recipes of all time,
        World's Best Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna
        recipes on the internet for two decades. Unfortunately, John unexpectedly passed away at 53 years old.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons
                parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about
                1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
                minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon
                salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles
                lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top
                with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with
                1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent
                sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 10</strong>
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
